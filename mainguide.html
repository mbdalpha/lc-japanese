    <h2 id="kana">Kana</h2>
    <p>
      Kana is basic phonetic "alphabet" in the Japanese language. 
      Hiragana exists for Japanese words while katakana exists for loan words 
      - words taken from other languages, in the same vein as pizza or piano being taken from Italian into English.
    <p>There is 46 basic characters for both systems, as well as a number of dakuten (two small lines like a quotation mark towards the top right of the character) 
      and han-dakuten (a small circle towards the top right) that effect the pronounciation. There is also combinations formed generally of the -い form plus a small や, ゆ, or よ. 
    </p>
    <p>Learning these is cruicial, most guides and textbooks you find online will expect you to know at least these. 
      I would recommend to look at the table below, <a href="http://japanese-lesson.com/characters/hiragana/hiragana_writing.html">practice</a> <a href="http://japanese-lesson.com/characters/katakana/katakana_writing.html">writing</a> them a number of times to get a grasp on stroke order 
      (as you will be expected to write them during the LC exam, it is not like the JPLT), 
      and then either using an <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/576084877">anki deck</a> 
      or just grinding them out using <a href="https://kana.pro/">this little browser game.</a> 
    </p>
      <br> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b5/Chart_of_kana.png" height="300px" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

    <p>You will be exposed to these continiously throughout learning Japanese and as such I would not worry too much about being 100% accurate yet or 
    worrying about revising these unless they become a problem for you.
    </p>
    <h3>But wait, what about that kanji stuff everybody talks about???</h3>
    <p>Ah yes the dreaded kanji. These are logographic characters used to represent either words or parts of words.
       There is <strong>A LOT</strong> of them in the language but even among native adults only about 3000-4000 would be known.
       They are a major part of the language and incredibly important for consuming Japanese media.
    </p>
    <p><strong>HOWEVER</strong> as a Leaving Cert Japanese student you are only expected to know a handful.
       I personally would recommend to learn to recognise more in order to allow you to immerse more and make reading nicer,
       but anything beyond <a href="https://ppli.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/11-Kanji-List.docx">this list</a>
       you are not expected to know how to reproduce, read or recognise without furigana.
    </p>
    <p>Continue reading if you want to learn more about learning kanji and general vocabulary.
    </p>

    <h2 id="vocab">Vocab</h2>
    <p>While <strong>TECHNICALLY</strong> you are expected to know all of the words at the end of each chapter in Nihongo Kantan.
      for the exam in reality you are not really expected to know every single one of these -- <strong>some vocab will be much more important for you than others.</strong>
      This is important as a number of words on the course are quite obscure even by the standard of the topic they belong to.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will be in an awkward position when you start learning Japanese, as you will have to get over the metaphorical "hump" of vocabulary and grammar before you
      are in a position to understand proper reading content. I would recommend either grinding out the first few chapters of the textbook (or if you feel that does not work for you
      starting to tackle the first few hundred vocab in a <a href='https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1196762551'>core vocab deck</a> - granted I personally found that these could burn me out quite easily when I was dipping my toes in the language 
      and if you're trying to speedrun this I'd only do it over a summer when you don't have much else to worry about).    
    </p>
    <p>
      I would also begin to learn basic grammar alongside this basic vocab - its your choice if you want to do most of the grammar on the course in one big push or in smaller sections
      more mirroring the method the textbook uses. See the next section for a bit more on that
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyways, back to the topic of vocabulary. Personally I found what is known as "mining" to be most effective for my vocab learning. Generally in the wider Japanese learning
      community this will be used to just refer to using a program such as Yomitan to quickly lookup and add unknown words to an anki deck while reading texts or consuming other immersion material.
      I like to expand this to the textbook and the exam papers - as while the vocabulary lists at the end of each chapter in Nihongo Kantan a number of them are not really used all that much and it it nicer to experience
      reading them in sentences and to allow you to have context with your flashcards. Try and add all the vocab to your deck as you come across them - it will be harder to go back and add them later, and the exercise
      you did where you found it will act as the "learning" state on which Anki flashcards only aim to keep recent. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you are at least relatively confident with reading basic sentences in Japanese I would definitely dive into reading some simpiler native content. Personal reccomendations for manga would be よつばと！
      (easier but might be less entertaining for some) and ハピネス (a tiny bit harder but is more action/tension focused) and for anime そうそうのフリーレン as while the magic/race discussion can be a bit confusing, 
      it is fine to skip over as a lot of the rest of the dialogue is quite down to earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can't decide for you what <strong>YOU</strong> personally feel as useful, but I would recommend to look at the topic cards and pictures for the oral
      and look through a number of exam papers and you can kind of get an idea - the majority of it is either simple everyday language or school related language.
    </p>
    <h2 id="grammar">Grammar</h2>
    <p>
      Grammar, a dreaded part for many in languages, is honestly pretty simple in Japanese compared to most other languages one could study for the Leaving Cert.
      Irregulars are very rare, during your LC study you will only encounter four irregular verbs, the coupla (behaving similarly to an irregular verb), and one irregular adjective.
      For the purpouses of grammar, only two main types of verbs exist (one of which is very simple to conjugate and the other is only slightly more diffcult). There is also no future form and it is instead lumped with the present form. You'll have to learn a number of particles and
      similar during the course, but realistically there is only a handful of them and the majority you will see so often that you will quickly internalise them. See below for a quick summary of the tenses on the LC exam (Taken from Nihongo Kantan - the offical textbook for LC Japanese) but if something confuses you I would recommend checking out <a href="https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/category/grammar-guide/basic-grammar/">Tae Kim's free online grammar guide</a>
      , or the <a href="https://dojglite.github.io/main/">Dictionary of Japanese Grammar</a> (mainly useful for particles) for better explainations.
